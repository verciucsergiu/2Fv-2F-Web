        <p>Entering our website you will be greeted by the welcome screen.</p>
        <img src="images/WelcomeScreen.png">
        <p>As a student, we can take the register steps, which as long as the CNP exists on the server, it will grant a student
            account linked to that specific CNP</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 35px;">Admin Guide</h1>
        <p>With admin rights, we have control over Groups,Teachers and Students. There are 3 main things an admin can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Invite a teacher.</p>
                <img src="images/InviteATeacher.png">
                <p>From here, the teacher has to accept the invitation and will be able to create an account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Create a student entity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From here, the student can create a user account linked to this student entity trough the CNP.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Manage groups and assign them to teachers</p>

        </ul>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 35px;">Teacher Guide</h1>
        <p>Once invited by the admin, using the link received on email, the teacher can register with a unique link in similar fashion to the student.</p>
        <img src="images/email.png">
        <p>After registering, the link expires and the teacher has to wait for an admin to assign him some groups to take care of.</p>
        <p>Now, the teacher can click on his page and choose one of his assigned groups.</p>
        <img src="images/TeacherWelcome.png">
        <img src="images/GroupOverView.png">
        <p>From here, the teacher can select a student to edit his grades, or go back and select another group</p>
        <img src="images/GradeOverview.png">
        <p>Editing some fields and then clicking save will update the students grades in the database</p>
